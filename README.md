# Sporedex
this application will allow mycologists to keep track of their genetics and make accurate notes of any observations they find

## why use the sporedex?
the sporedex will help users in several ways. When i got started in the world of mycology there was so much i didn't know as i was not formally taught, everything i learned was taught to me by my mentor and through experience on my own. I learned to observe the fruits more, to see how much water to add to the substrate to get field capacity juuuuust right, or observe the aggresiveness of the mycelium, how many fruit bodies will pop up, what size they are, their density, started taking mental notes of the genetic lines and where they begin to take on new traits. although i have observed these things in my practice i never actually wrote them down anywhere or kept actual data on my varieties. so this app will help with just that

## what it do?
this app will help a mycologist:
* keep track of all the genetics/species they have in their sporedex
* log any observations they've made with a specific genetic such as: how quickly it grows, the characteristics of the mycelium, prefered substrate/grains & agar recipes
* keep track of teks that work for that mycologist step by step so they can improve their sterile technique and have accurate data as to where they may have went wrong and improve that step where they believe they're running into contamination. log how they fixed the issue and move forward
* keep track of mycelium they're currently working. when isolating genetics a mycologist will cut out pieces of good healthy mycelium and transfer that to a new plate and monitor growth on their new plates. if you're doing a lot of genetic work like serial dilution it can be tough to keep track of all the different plates you got going, with the sporedex even a beginning mycologist will have a spot they can keep better track of everything and gain experience faster and most importantly... WITH ACCURATE DATA
